## [2.0.0] - 2016-06-27
### Added
- Mappable cursor commands. Characters in a string can invoke cursor commands
- Stack printing. Extra cells can be layers over and under the main screen
- Entire screen can be filled with a single, specified cell
- Individual cells can now be directly manipulated in place (by reference)
- "Cs" standard alias shortcut for "sw::ConsoleScreen"
- Switchable palette mode (standard/rgb). Standard is default
- If a full colour is used in standard palette mode, either the colour will added to the palette or the closest match in the palette is used
- Ability to get current print properties
- Many simple types to use in the "stream" to specify different information
- Ability to move the print position by an offset
